Under stress, granular materials deform elastically like a solid, yet begin to flow like a fluid when a certain stress threshold is surpassed. Significant variations in momentum and volume fraction across different regions of granular media lead to intricate multiphase system dynamics. These conditions have historically constrained modeling to discrete particle methods, as opposed to fluids where Navier-Stokes equations can be applied. \n Particularly problematic is the propulsion across sandy surfaces, hindered by phenomena such as sand trapping and skidding.  prominent example is the Curiosity rover on Mars, which can be immobilized for hours on the planet’s dusty terrain. Therefore, robots specifically designed for granular locomotion are being developed, equipped with integrated circuits that enable them to implement directives based on sensor data, thereby optimizing their movement by adapting to the environmental conditions. \n Our study focuses on granular media consisting of particles larger than 100 micrometers, such as sand, gravel, and grains. We delve into the problematic nature of locomotion in such environments, drawing inspiration from the natural world. Snakes across the globe exhibit a range of strategies to navigate diverse terrains, including solid ground, ocean surfaces, tropical forests, and deserts. In particular, certain serpent species adeptly traverse sandy landscapes through a combination of lateral undulations and elevations of their body segments. This project investigates the types of movements that enable snakes to efficiently move across sandy environments, with implications for robotics that can inform the development of mechanisms for improved navigation in granular media.","tags":null,"title":"Robot Serpent Locomotion","type":"project"},

Generally, in parallel robots, solving the forward kinematic problem (FKP) is much harder than finding the inverse kinematic solution (IKP), thus, workspace determination using FKP is a demanding task in most cases. Therefore, in this paper, a progressive growing neural gas network algorithm (PGNGN) is proposed, which is a systematic and general approach to obtain the topology of the workspace based on IKP equations. After establishing a preliminary network with few initial data points, the network starts to develop itself by considering new data points around its border neurons through a boundary data generation procedure. The proposed algorithm is able to continue learning, adding units and connections, until a performance criterion has been met which leads to a clear workspace topology with minimal errors. Finally, as case studies, the workspace of two planar 3-DOF parallel robots with 3-RPR and 3-PRR structures are studied. Results reveal the applicability and reliability of this method.","tags":[],"title":"Workspace Determination of Planar Parallel Robots via Progressive Growing Neural Gas Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project, proposes a new extension of the Growing Neural Gas Network, called the Progressive Growing Neural Gas Network (PGNGN), for the application of kinematic investigation of parallel mechanisms, with more emphasis on the singularity-free workspace determination.
