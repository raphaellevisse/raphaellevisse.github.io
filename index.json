The concern of patient safety becomes even more critical in healthcare settings where robots interact with humans. In this paper, we propose a novel risk-aware planning framework to minimize the risk of patient falls by providing a patient with an assistive device. Our approach combines learning-based prediction with model-based control to plan for the fall prevention tasks. This provides advantages compared to end-to-end learning methods in which the robot's performance is limited to specific scenarios, or purely model-based approaches that use relatively simple function approximators and are prone to high modeling errors.

It is worth mentioning that, in this paper, all the probable collisions, i.e., the collision between the mechanism and the obstacles and also among the links, are taken into accounts. Two general cases have been considered in collision-free path planning simulation; the first case considered a mobile robot in several workspaces and the second one was assigned to the 3-RRR parallel robot path planning. Results of the simulations, which are implemented in C programming language for the sake of real-time purposes. reveal that for the both cases, the newly proposed hybrid path planning method is efficient enough for the mobile robot, or the end-effector of the planar parallel robot to reach the goal without colliding with the obstacles.","tags":[],"title":"Path planning of 3-RRR parallel robot by avoiding mechanical interferences via Artificial Potential Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project we focused on making the motion planning of the robots fault-tolerant.

Generally, in parallel robots, solving the forward kinematic problem (FKP) is much harder than finding the inverse kinematic solution (IKP), thus, workspace determination using FKP is a demanding task in most cases. Therefore, in this paper, a progressive growing neural gas network algorithm (PGNGN) is proposed, which is a systematic and general approach to obtain the topology of the workspace based on IKP equations. After establishing a preliminary network with few initial data points, the network starts to develop itself by considering new data points around its border neurons through a boundary data generation procedure. The proposed algorithm is able to continue learning, adding units and connections, until a performance criterion has been met which leads to a clear workspace topology with minimal errors. Finally, as case studies, the workspace of two planar 3-DOF parallel robots with 3-RPR and 3-PRR structures are studied. Results reveal the applicability and reliability of this method.","tags":[],"title":"Workspace Determination of Planar Parallel Robots via Progressive Growing Neural Gas Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This project, proposes a new extension of the Growing Neural Gas Network, called the Progressive Growing Neural Gas Network (PGNGN), for the application of kinematic investigation of parallel mechanisms, with more emphasis on the singularity-free workspace determination.

In this algorithm, the network starts to grow by taking into account new data points close to its border neurons by resorting to the so-called boundary data generation procedure.\nBy considering singularity loci expression, the separated parts are detected and each part will pursue learning, adding units and connections, until a given performance criterion will be reached. Finally, after finding cavities, if any exists, the maximal circle for each part of the workspace is found. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed providing the users with easy access to the important parameters in which the singularity-free workspace of three planar three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel mechanisms are investigated in which two of them, namely, 3-RRR and 3-PRR parallel mechanisms, are among the most complicated parallel mechanisms due to their highly nonlinear and complicated singularity loci expressions.
