      <title>Risk-Aware Planning</title>

      <description>In order to assist the patient efficiently, we develop a risk-aware planning framework which finds the best manipulation plan that minimizes the fall risk probability with minimum robot effort. We view the risk-aware planning problem from the perspective of probabilistic inference and solve it as a multi-objective optimization problem. For the fall risk objective, we use a linear combination of expected value and CVaR to minimize the overall risk of fall while avoiding even low probabilities of high fall risks.</description>

      <title>Human Posture Optimization</title>

      <description>Although teleoperation is a promising alternative to avoid injuries in high-risk tasks, awkward postures are still a primary contributor to works-related musculoskeletal disorders in teleoperation. An ergonomically intelligent teleoperation system could reduce risk by providing feedback for postural correction. In this project, we introduce a novel framework for postural optimization in teleoperation that benefits from common risk assessment tools in ergonomics and provides online postural correction as well as optimal initial posture correction for a teleoperator according to the type of teleoperation task.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Hospital Patient Room Design</title>

      <description>Despite years of research into patient falls in hospital rooms, falls and related injuries remain a serious concern to patient safety. In this work, we formulate a gradient-free constrained optimization problem to generate and reconfigure the hospital room interior layout to minimize the risk of falls. We define a cost function built on a hospital room fall model that takes into account the supportive or hazardous effect of the patient’s surrounding objects, as well as simulated patient trajectories inside the room.</description>

      <title>Patient Fall Risk Evaluation Model</title>

      <description>A major safety concern in hospitals is patient falls. Falls often increase length of stay, reduce quality of life, and are costly to both patients and health care providers. This project focuses on fall risk prediction based on environmental features and provides an optimized patient hospital room design to decrease risk of fall. We have developed an algorithm to find fall risk distributions within a room or along a trajectory based on fixed environmental features, semi-variable patient features, and variable trajectory features.</description>

      <title>Mobile Manipulation Planning</title>
      <link>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/pam/</link>

      <description>In this project we introduce a patient assistant mobile (PAM) robot to monitor patient behavior and provide a cost-effective physical presence to continuously observe a patient and the environment to prevent falls.
Many common objects found inside hospital rooms and personal dwellings have legs (e.g. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). For a mobile robot operating in such environments, safely maneuvering these objects without collision is essential. Since providing the robot with dynamic models of all possible legged objects that may exist in such environments is not feasible, autonomous learning of an approximate dynamic model for these objects would significantly improve manipulation planning.</description>

      <title>Human Posture Estimation in p-HRI</title>
      <link>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/pose_estimation/</link>

      <description>Human posture estimation has been a challenging research problem and many solutions has been suggested for different applications. Mainly, marker-based motion capture system and markerless camera-bases systems are the most common methods to estimate human posture. Marker-based solutions are usually more accurate however they require a long preparation time for setting up parkers and calibration of mocap systems. Markerless are more convenient since they does not requires attaching markers on human body.</description>

      <title>Robotic Ankle Foot Simulator</title>

      <description>A novel actuated gait simulator has been developed that fits inside a typical shoe and has sufficient load capability and range of motion to mimic adult gait patterns. The control system includes passive ankle stiffness which is responsible for a more biomechanical behavior. The ankle demonstrates passive ankle stiffness when irregular terrain is encountered. Beyond the present application of the device as a testing platform for haptic smart orthotics, it can also be used as a test platform for studying slip events between different types of shoes and varying terrain.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/ft_motion_planning/</link>

      <guid>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/ft_motion_planning/</guid>
      <description>In this project we focused on making the motion planning of the robots fault-tolerant. We started with the simple Pseudo inverse approach to making the joint trajectory planning of planar redundant serial robots the fault tolerant. We made a 4-DOF planar robot (TaArm) to do the experimental studies to show the performance of the proposed method.

End-effector’s linear velocity of the manipulator. The failure occurs at tf = 15s and the simulation time is 20s.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Optimal Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/mpc_path_planning/</link>

      <guid>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/mpc_path_planning/</guid>
      <description>This project focuses on the optimal path planning of redundant planar serial robots, while avoiding obstacles within its workspace. A synergy-based algorithm between convex optimization, disjunctive programming and receding horizon is employed to the end of achieving advantages such as finding the global optimum solution and low computational time.
This algorithm can handle both static and dynamic obstacles due to its replanning scheme. It has been implemented on redundant serial robots, parallel robots, mobile robots and a group of mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Progressive Growing Neural Gas Networks (PGNGN)</title>
      <link>https://raphaellevisse.github.io/project/pgngn/</link>

      <description>This project, proposes a new extension of the Growing Neural Gas Network, called the Progressive Growing Neural Gas Network (PGNGN), for the application of kinematic investigation of parallel mechanisms, with more emphasis on the singularity-free workspace determination. In fact, PGNGN leads to a general approach in order to obtain the topology of the workspace. In this algorithm, the network starts to grow by taking into account new data points close to its border neurons by resorting to the so-called boundary data generation procedure.</description>
